	<h3>How do I join an Alaska Futsal League team?</h3>
	
	<div>
	<p>Those interested in playing in the 2022 Fall Session Futsal League must be a current registered Alaska Youth Soccer player, and be rostered on an affiliate team. Registration will be done by the team manager, or coach, on the AYSA website.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>How many players are allowed on a team?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Roster size for all divisions will be a minimum of 7 players, and a maximum of 11 players. Smaller teams means more play time.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Will there be a discount for multiple teams?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Yes. A competitive team that enters their team as two futsal teams will receive a $25 discount off the second and third team entry fees.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Are teams formed in true age divisions?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Yes. Our goal is to maintain the integrity of the league and provide an opportunity for as many players as possible to play the game of Futsal. To this end, we ask that teams register within their true age. Alaska Youth Soccer will follow the U.S. Soccer PDI standards and guidelines. Teams that register outside of their age group while maintaining a true age roster will be moved to the appropriate division, unless they received approval through an <a href = "/assets/129/6/22-AFL_Team_Waiver.pdf" target = "_blank">AFL Team Waiver</a> requesting to play up an age group. Rosters will be reviewed by the AFL committee to ensure that teams are placed properly to ensure appropriate competition. Teams are not allowed to play down an age group.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Will age groups be combined?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Possibly. Each division must have at least four registered teams to be a valid division. AYSA reserves the right to drop or combine divisions or age groups. For the 16-U and older teams with mixed age groups, registration will be at the age of the oldest player on the roster.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>What is the game format?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>The game format is 5v5 (4+GK), with a 3-player minimum, with two equal periods of 22-minute halves with a 2-minute halftime. The clock will run without interruption until there are 2 minutes left in the half, after which the clock will be stopped during stoppages in play.</p>
	<p>Teams are allowed one 1-minute time-out per half. Unused time-outs do not carry over into the next half, and no time-outs will be allowed during the last 2 minutes of a half. Time-outs may only be utilized by the team in possession of the ball, during a stoppage in play due to the ball going out of bounds.</p>
	<p>See the <a href = "/assets/129/6/22_afl_rulesmaster_09092022.pdf" target = "_blank">2022 AYS AFL Rules</a> for a full set of rules.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>When will games be played?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Usually, games are scheduled on Saturday and Sunday starting as early as 9am with the final kickoff of the night at 7pm. Some games may be played on Friday, but keeping games on the weekends is the objective. Due to the combined league size and composition the schedule could change. The schedule is dictated by the court times AYSA can secure through the facilities.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Where will the league games be played?</h3>

	<div>
	<!--p>For the 2022 season, AFL will schedule games only in the Anchorage area. The currently utilized venues are Eagle River High School, Mears Middle School, Central Middle School, Begich Middle School, and South High School. This list is subject to addition and change as needed.</p-->
	<p>This section will be updated when the upcoming season draws nearer.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>How does a team qualify for Futsal State Cup?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Teams and players must play within the league to qualify to attend the Alaska Futsal State Cup. Teams entered from out of district must play at least four sanctioned games to qualify for State Cup.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Will player cards and futsal team rosters be required for league games?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Yes. Rosters and player cards <b>must</b> be provided to the referee at each game for 10-U and older divisions. Cards and rosters may be provided either electronically or in hard-copy.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Will 10-U standings be posted?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>The referee will record the scores and report them to AYSA for 12-U and older Divisions. The 9-U/10-U divisions will not keep standings.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Will competitive club passes be allowed?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Yes, <a href = "/assets/129/6/19-PP50706A1_Club_Pass-Updated_2-12-19.pdf" target = "_blank">club pass policy</a> will be followed.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Will coaches with multiple teams be accommodated?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>Alaska Youth Soccer will accommodate coaches with multiple teams by scheduling them with back-to-back games at the same facility as much as possible. We encourage you to split your outdoor teams into two futsal teams.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Can I cancel my registration for a refund?</h3>

	<div>
	<p>You may cancel your registration any time prior to the registration deadline and receive a refund of your fees minus a $150 administrative charge. After the deadline, there are no refunds. See the <a href = "/assets/129/6/AFL_Team_Refund_and_Forfeited_Guidelines.pdf" target = "_blank">AFL Refund and Registration Guidelines</a>.</p>
