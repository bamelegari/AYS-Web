<h2>You Have A Role To Play!</h2>

<p>As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, AYSA relies on contributions in a variety of formats in support of our mission of developing and growing the game of soccer throughout the State of Alaska. AYSA is a leader in virtually every aspect of the game throughout the state, and offers high-quality programs, events and services to our membership through the generous support of our members, corporate sponsors, foundations, and individual donors.</p>

<h5>Financial Contributions</h5>
<p>AYSA's goal is to ensure that all of our programs can be enjoyed by one and all regardless of cost. We rely on individuals, corporations, and grants to make this a reality. All financial donations can be specified by area of interest and will be utilized to provide scholarships to individuals within those programs or sponsor programs directly to help us provide outreach programs or tournaments throughout Alaska. Financial contributions can be utilized to provide scholarships within the following programs: TOPSoccer, ADP/ODP, Coaching Education, Referee Education or to support the Alaska State Cup Tournament held statewide every August.</p>
