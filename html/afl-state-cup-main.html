<h5>From The Executive Director</h5>
<p>It is with regret that I have to cancel the Alaska State Futsal Cup for 2022. After reviewing the potential schedule of games, and then discussing the lack of referees, it was concluded that there was no way to cover all the futsal games with the referee shortage. Without this confirmation, I could not allow for the competition to move forward.</p>

<p>The lack of referees is not specific to soccer but to youth sports as a whole. I have been in communication and am working with the Referee Association to increase our referee pool.</p>

	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<div>

A minimum of 3 players (including the goalkeeper) is required to start or continue play.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Can a player be rostered on more than one team?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>No. Dual rostering is not allowed. Players and teams currently registered under the AYSA umbrella and in good standing with AYSA are eligible to participate. Players and teams must be Alaska-based and residents to register.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>How long is a game?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>A game consists of two equal periods of 22 minutes, with a 2-minute half time.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
			<p>TBD</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Will player cards be required for the tournament?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>No. Approved rosters will be verified by the referee at each game.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Will event passes be used?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>No, however team rosters must list technical area staff (coach, manager, DOC/TD, etc.)</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Will 10-U standings be posted?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>Yes. The referee will record the scores, and report them to AYSA for 10-U and older divisions.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Will competitive club passes be allowed?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>Yes &mdash; prior to the roster lock, you may club pass a registered AYSA player to a team for the tournament, but once the roster locks, they must remain rostered on the team that was submitted. The AFL State Cup Roster will be locked prior to the start of the tournament with no additions allowed after that date.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Are guest players allowed?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>Yes. Registered AFL players may transfer from a club team not participating in Futsal State Cup to a club team that is participating. Transfer fees will apply. The team accepting a player from a non-participating team for Futsal State Cup will only be allowed two (2) temporary transfer approvals for their Futsal State Cup roster. See the relevant <a href = "/assets/129/6/21-Futsal_Temp_Transfer_and_Transfer.pdf" target = "_blank">form</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Will coaches with multiple teams be accommodated?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>Alaska Youth Soccer will accommodate coaches up to 2 teams by scheduling games within a reasonable timeframe if possible. All teams are required to list an assistant coach/manager on the roster for conflicts by game time or location.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Can I cancel my registration for a refund?</h3>
			
			<div>
			<p>You may cancel your registration any time prior to the registration deadline to receive a refund of your fees minus a $250 administrative fee. After the deadline, no refunds will be offered. Forfeiting a scheduled tournament game will result in a fine to the team of $500 per forfeit.</p>
