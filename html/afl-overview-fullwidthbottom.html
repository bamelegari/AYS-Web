	<p>Futsal is a high-intensity, fast-paced, dynamic, and enjoyable 5-a-side version of soccer that caters to both male and female participants. It is the only 5-a-side game that is officially recognized by FIFA and is one of the fastest growing sports in the world.</p>

	<p>Futsal is played on a smaller, hard-court surface with a smaller, low bounce ball. It is played with touchline boundaries and without walls. Without the use of walls, futsal is a great skill-developer, demanding quick reflexes, fast thinking, and pin-point passing. Because of the smaller court size, all players are constantly involved and there is never a dull moment, as defense transforms to attack in a split second. The court size helps players develop close control, quick decision making, and speed and agility. </p>

	<p>Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. The surface and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, technique and ball control and passing in small spaces.</p>

	<p>Alaska Youth Soccer recognizes that the statewide Futsal league will serve as a venue and pathway for the state's youth soccer players to further develop their skills at all levels and ages while providing opportunities to become elite players at the state level along with the promotion of club development and growth.</p>

	<p>The Futsal League will offer recreational and competitive levels for youth and cup-based competition while encouraging good sportsmanship and fair play of all the participants. Future plans include state-wide Futsal camp and clinic training opportunities for player development. There will also be an opportunity to apply for individual <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfY4jh5ZmTBB4R5q4Ni55Hb5dnJ5imO7CyoY-FmHONcX-XbYg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target = "_blank">equipment grants</a> to district clubs to assist with the development of their futsal programs.</p>

	<p>The league provides Futsal game opportunities with a low-pressure schedule allowing teams to commit. The schedule allows for team practices and other team events. The Alaska Futsal State Cup Tournament will take place December 9-11 for boys teams, and December 16-18 for girls teams.</p>

	<p>AYSA will be responsible for sanctioning the Alaska Futsal League (AFL) and Alaska Futsal State Cup Tournament.

We look forward to working with the clubs, teams, and players as we move forward to develop youth soccer statewide through futsal program opportunities.</p>

	<h2>Futsal in Alaska</h2>
	
	<p>AYSA was the recipient of the 2017 US Soccer Innovate to Grow Grant. AYSA developed and facilitated a statewide Futsal Program called the Alaska Futsal League (AFL) in 2017. The AFL would provide regulation futsal games in a league format for youth teams statewide, in a flexible environment where the game could be played indoor on a basketball court or outdoor on a tennis court or parking lot.</p>
	
	<p>In 2017, AFL's first year, AYSA registered 36 teams, provided a futsal coaching clinic, futsal referee certification (5 refs), provided affiliate clubs futsal goals and balls, and facilitated an eight-week league of games in one location and provided a tournament.</p>
	
	<p>In 2018, AYSA registered 70 teams, provided affiliate clubs futsal equipment, increased state participation to include two other district clubs, certified 30 futsal referees, and facilitated an eight-week league of games in three locations statewide and provided a futsal state cup tournament.</p>
	
	<p>In 2019, AYSA registered 85 teams, increased state participation to include an additional two district clubs, certified 38 futsal referees and facilitated an eight-week league of games in three locations statewide and provided a futsal state cup tournament.</p>
	
	<p>In 2020, AYSA registered 32 teams, decreased due to COVID-19 mitigation and travel restrictions, certified 15 futsal referees and facilitated a six-week league of games at one location in Anchorage and was unable to provide a futsal state cup tournament.</p>
	
	<p>The success of the AFL program has led to all five districts providing a futsal platform within their own program; eight clubs currently have facilitated their own futsal program along with participating in the AFL program.</p>
	
	<p>AYSA has recognized that the statewide futsal league has served as a new venue and pathway for youth soccer players to further develop their skills while providing opportunities to become elite players at the state level, along with the continued promotion of our affiliate clubs' development and growth.</p>
	
	<p>The league offers recreational and competitive levels for youth and cup-based competition while encouraging good sportsmanship and fair play by all the participants. Future programs include state-wide futsal camps and clinic training opportunities for player development. AYSA offers a yearly opportunity to apply for individual equipment grants to district clubs to assist with the development of their futsal programs by supplying futsal balls and goals.</p>
	
	<p>The league provides futsal game opportunities with a low-pressure schedule allowing teams to commit. The schedule allows for team practices and other team events. The Alaska Futsal State Cup Tournament will take place the first two weekends in December.</p>
