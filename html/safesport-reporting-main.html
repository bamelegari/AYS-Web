<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Alaska Youth Soccer Association (AYSA) has a zero tolerance policy for abuse. AYSA encourages a culture of communication regarding matters that place athletes at risk.

<p>The Code of Conduct also provides evidence of AYSA's commitment to the lawful and ethical conduct of its members/participants and to protect those who report violations consistent with the <a href="/assets/129/6/19-Whistleblower_Policy_AYSA090109-Update_2-12-19.pdf" target="_blank">Whistleblower Policy; AYSA090109</a>.
