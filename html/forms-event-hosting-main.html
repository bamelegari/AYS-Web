<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>

	<li><b>NEW: If you host a tournament, festival, jamboree, or camp, you must submit an AYSA Post-Event Report as well as a Referee Assignor Report to the AYSA State Office within 30 days of the event.</b></li>

	<li>Affiliates must be in good standing with AYSA before they will be considered for sanctioned event hosting.</li> 

	<li>Incidents of referee or player assault <b>MUST</b> be reported within 48 hours.</li>

	<li>If an affiliate-sanctioned event has scheduling conflicts with an AYSA-sponsored event, the AYSA event takes precedence. Questions may be directed to <a href="mailto:alaskayouthsoccer@gmail.com">alaskayouthsoccer@gmail.com</a>.</li>

	<li>Applicants agree that all games will use only U.S. Soccer registered referees who are in good standing. There will be an adequate number of US Soccer registered referees available in the area during the league/tournament to cover the scheduled games. Applicants also agree to use an Alaska approved assignor to assign referees for those games.</li>


	<li>Adult Verification for Sanctioned Events: Applicants, please ensure all adults who will have direct contact <b>including those not registered with an Alaska-affiliated club</b> have submitted an AYSA background check application, reviewed the AYSA Code of Conduct, and completed the SafeSport training. Out of state staff coaches who have a current approved background check certificate, and SafeSport training certificate will need to submit those documents to the AYSA State Office for approval prior to conducting the sanctioned event in Alaska.</li>
