	<h5>Coach Education</h5>
	<p>Coaches registering for education programs will be expected to pay for courses in full prior to stated date of the course.

	<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<h5>Policy</h5>
	<p>A policy is a rule set by the Board of Directors for all affiliate members of Alaska Youth Soccer to follow. Policies can be reviewed and modified by the Executive Director and the Board of Directors as needed. Affiliate member organizations may be stricter than Alaska Youth Soccer in their application of the policy, but not more lenient. The interpretation and enforcement of the policy is governed by the AYSA Executive Director and Board of Directors. Exceptions should first be requested of the AYSA Office.</p>

	<h5>Guidelines</h5>
	<p>Not policy, but suggestions that affiliate members are encouraged to adopt as part of their program protocols.</p>

	<h5>Bylaws</h5>
	<p>The overall governing document of the organization. Bylaws can only be modified and changed at the AGM by the AYSA Board of Directors</p>
