<h2>AYSA Scholarship Fund</h2>
<p>Alaska Youth Soccer will continue to ensure that we provide resources for youth who otherwise might be left on the bench. AYSA will be expanding the player scholarship fund for the 2020-21 seasonal year in the hopes that we can assist families who have been affected by this pandemic and provide opportunities for players to participate in soccer within their community.</p>

<p>Alaska Youth Soccer is proud to offer financial assistance for soccer families seeking to participate in Alaska affiliate club soccer programs. Our goal is to help eliminate the financial obstacle that may otherwise prevent a player from being a part of AYSA family.</p>
