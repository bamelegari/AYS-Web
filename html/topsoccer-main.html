	<p><a href="https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/programs/topsoccer/" target = "_blank">US Youth Soccer TOPSoccer</a> (The Outreach Program for Soccer) is a community-based training and team placement program for young athletes with disabilities.</p>

	<p>The program is designed to bring the opportunity of learning and playing soccer to any boy or girl, who has a mental or physical disability. Our goal is to enable all young athletes with disabilities to become valued and successful members of the US Youth Soccer and Alaska Youth Soccer Family.<br />
	TOPSoccer was formed to perpetuate the US Youth Soccer mission statement which is, in part, &quot;to foster the physical, mental and emotional growth and development of America&#39;s youth through the sport of soccer at all levels of age and competition.&quot; There are thousands of children with disabilities who need, and can be provided with, the opportunity to play soccer through the TOPSoccer Program.</p>

	<p>The TOPSoccer Program in Alaska began in 2002 by Linda Kelly, with one location. Alaska now has programs across the state offering soccer experiences to young athletes with disabilities. The TOPSoccer Program in Alaska is overseen by Alaska Youth Soccer Association, and hosted by Affiliate Members. Alaska Youth Soccer provides support to the Affiliate Members for the development and training opportunities.</p>

	<p>Join and become involved in one of Alaska&#39;s TOPSoccer Programs by volunteering as a TOPSoccer Coach or TOPSoccer Buddy. TOPSoccer Buddies are typically high school age students who assist the coach during program practices and games.</p>
