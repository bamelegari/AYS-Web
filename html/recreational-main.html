<h2>Nurture, Encourage, &amp; Support</h2>

<p>Alaska Youth Soccer believes in the power soccer has in transforming the lives of children by offering them a fun outlet for creativity, healthy living, and a positive community environment in which they can thrive!</p>

<p>Recreational soccer programs in Alaska are for the enjoyment and development of soccer players without the heavy emphasis on competition.</p>

<p>Players can register directly with a recreational program that is an AYSA affiliate club and/or league. Each player will have the opportunity to develop and enhance his or her soccer skills by participating in recreational soccer.</p>

<p>A recreational team is a rostered group of players that regularly plays against other recreational teams. Programs will employ a system of rostering players for the purpose of creating a fair and balanced distribution of playing talent among all participating teams.</p>

<p>A recreational league is a league comprised solely of recreational teams. Recreational leagues are focused primarily on offering youth opportunities with soccer in a balanced, competitive, and safe setting. The players are given the opportunity to play an equal amount of game time in each game.</p>
