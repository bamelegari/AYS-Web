<p>Recognize to Recover is aimed at promoting safe play and reducing injuries in soccer players of all ages. The program was developed with the help of medical experts to provide coaches, players, parents, and referees with information, guidance, and additional educational materials to improve the prevention and management of injuries. Injury prevention is central to safe play. U.S. Soccer's Recognize to Recover program provides resources and guidance to help players fight off injury so they can stay on the field. Not all injuries can be avoided, but the severity and probability of injury can be reduced through proper conditioning, training routines and good sportsmanship, making the game of soccer safer for all who participate.</p>

<p>We start with a food first philosophy when it comes to fueling athletes - informed choices and a well-designed nutrition plan can meet the nutritional needs of most healthy athletes. However, it is often challenging for athletes to design and put into action a complete fueling plan. Time constraints, access to fresh, whole foods and grocery stores, culinary and nutritional knowledge, underestimating the additional demands of sport, recovery, and growth are all factors that lead many athletes to fall short of the recommended levels of nutrients. An individual's nutritional needs are as unique as their fingerprints, so understanding what causes nutritional needs to be different can help a person choose the best combination of foods and supplements to best meet their needs.</p>
