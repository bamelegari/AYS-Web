	<h3>What are the procedures for guest players and player transfers in State Cup?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<p>A transfer is defined as the process by which a player changes club affiliation, moving from one club and re-registering to a team within a different club within the same seasonal year. US Youth Soccer and Alaska Youth Soccer seasonal year runs from September 1 through August 31st.</p>
		
		<h5>State Cup Transfers</h5>
		
		<p>Competitive players must be properly registered under the current Alaska seasonal year and living in Alaska prior to the July State Cup application deadline. Players who transfer from one participating club team to another participating club team after the July State Cup application deadline will be ineligible for participation in the current seasonal year Alaska State Cup. Requirements are outlined in the <a href = "/assets/129/6/policy_no_sc42006-transfers_to-from_state_cup_teams-2-3-21.pdf" target = "_blank">Transfers for State Cup Policy</a>.</p>
		
		<p>From May until the State Cup final roster freeze date, players may transfer from a club team not participating in State Cup to a club team that is participating. Transfer fees apply and the maximum number of allowed transfers is four (4). The Temporary Release and Transfer form (available <a href = "/programs-and-leagues/state-cup/forms-policies/" target = "_blank">here</a>) will only be accepted starting after the July State Cup application deadline.</p>
		
		<h5>Roster Freeze Deadline</h5>
		
		<p>The team accepting a player from a non-participating team for State Cup will only be allowed four (4) temporary transfer approvals for their State Cup roster. No additions or transfers will be accepted or considered after the State Cup final roster freeze date, no exceptions.</p>
		<p>In the event a team disbands from State Cup before the final roster freeze date, players from the team may request a transfer to a State Cup bound team on an individual basis. Requests must go through the AYSA office and will be reviewed by the State Cup Committee. Transfer fees will apply.</p>
		
		<h5>Recreational Players</h5>
		<p>Recreational players may be added to a State Cup roster with no additional AYSA paperwork required. The players must be properly registered with AYSA and rostered with AYSA in accordance with the rules of US Youth Soccer (<a href = "/assets/129/6/players_and_playing_rules_policy_app_7.11.2020.pdf" target = "_blank">Policy on Players and Playing Rules</a>, 201 and 209). No out-of-state players or guest players can be rostered to a State Cup team. </p>
	
	</div>

	<h3>What are the procedures for transferring competitive players?</h3>

	<div>
		<h5>Transfer Defenition</h5>
		<p>A transfer is defined as the process by which a player changes club affiliation, moving from one club and re-registering to a team within a different club within the same seasonal year. The US Youth Soccer and Alaska Youth Soccer seasonal year runs from September 1 - August 31.</p>
		<p>The transfer procedure will not apply to a player that is transferring from within the state thirty-day open tryout window which starts directly after the completion of the Alaska State Cup Tournament; there will be no paperwork, fee or wait period required in this case.</p>
	
		<h5>Transfer Policy</h5>
		<p>Players transferring from one affiliate club and/or association to another affiliate club and/or association during the current Alaska seasonal year must complete the <a href = "/assets/129/6/2023_Update_Transfer_and_Release_Form.pdf" target = "_blank">Transfer and Release Form</a> available on the <a href = "/resources/player-in-state-forms/" target = "_blank">Player Forms Page</a>. The intent of this policy is to ensure that competitive players are released from their current affiliate club team commitment and remain in good standing with Alaska Youth Soccer and US Youth Soccer.</p>
		
		<h5>Transfer Requirements</h5>
		<p>Competitive players are to be properly registered to an affiliate club for the soccer seasonal year. A transfer will be required once a player has committed to the club even if no games and/or practices have occurred. The transfer procedure applies to the player that is transferring from their registered/affiliate club (with the opportunity of placement within the current club) to another club that is forming/expanding a team in their age division.</p>
		<p>The transfer procedure applies to a player that is transferring from their registered/affiliate club to another club regardless of the player's status (competitive, recreational, league registration).</p>
		
		<h5>Transfer Procedure</h5>
		<p>Players will ensure that all current financial obligations have been met with their registered club prior to transferring. AYSA will require a 7-day wait period for the transferred player once the transfer has been approved. The player may not participate in games or practices or be listed on a roster or have an Alaska Youth Soccer/US Youth Soccer player pass issued by either team. The player will only be permitted to practice with the accepting club team during the wait period with the approval of the AYSA office. An exception to the 7-day wait period may be granted under extenuating circumstances with the approval of the AYSA Office.</p>
		<p>The <a href = "/assets/129/6/2023_Update_Transfer_and_Release_Form.pdf" target = "_blank">Transfer and Release Form</a> requires a transfer fee of $75 payable to AYSA at the time of submission. Payment must be received for the release and transfer request to be processed. The player transferring from one club to another club must complete the release and transfer form and receive approval by AYSA prior to committing to the new club and registering for the new team.</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<h3>What is the Alaska open tryout window?</h3>

	<div>
		<p>A thirty-day open tryout window applies for all competitive registered players. Normal transfer requirements will not apply to a player that is transferring from within the state during the window which starts directly after the completion of the Alaska State Cup Tournament; there will be no paperwork, fee or wait period required during this time. Players transferring within the AYSA thirty-day open tryout period will need to ensure all current financial obligations have been met with their registered club in order to change clubs.</p>
		<p><b>Important note: </b>Once a player, verbally or in writing, commits to a club at any time during the seasonal year (September 1 - August 31), a transfer will be required even if no games and/or practices have occurred.</p>
		<h5>Supplemental Tryouts</h5>
		<p>A player wishing to attend a tryout with another club first must be released by their current club, ensuring all current financial obligations have been met. Transfer guidelines are to be followed to stay in an accordance to the <a href = "/assets/129/6/players_and_playing_rules_policy_app_7.11.2020.pdf" target = "_blank">US Youth Soccer Policy on Players and Playing Rules</a> Rule 201. Section 3 and the <a href = "/assets/129/6/21-Anti_Recruitment_Policy-2-17-21.pdf" target = "_blank">AYSA Anti-Enticement-Recruitment Policy</a>.</p>
		<p>Supplemental tryouts will be held yearly (April 15 - May 15). If a player is not officially released by AYSA, they must present a completed <a href = "/assets/129/6/2023_Update_Transfer_and_Release_Form.pdf" target = "_blank">AYSA Transfer and Release Form</a> signed by the parent and releasing club. The supplemental tryouts are considered restricted. Transfer guidelines will apply, including the required 7-day wait period.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>What are AYSA's parent organizations?</h3>

	<div>
		Alaska Youth Soccer Association is a member of US Soccer and US Youth Soccer, which is made up of four (4) regions. AYSA is a member of the West Region (Region IV) of US Youth Soccer.
	</div>
	
	<h3>What registration platform does AYSA use?</h3>

	<div>
		<p>GotSoccer is the official registration platform for AYSA. Club registrars will process all AYSA player and team registrations in GotSoccer. All players, team staff and volunteers will have their own GotSoccer accounts. AYSA league registration, as well as many tournament registrations, will be submitted through their GotSoccer accounts. Account login and password information is obtained from your team’s Club Registrar.</p>
		<p><b>Helpful hint:</b> The &quot;Help&quot; button on the lower right corner of the GotSoccer screen is a useful how-to resource and includes the ability to chat with a GotSoccer expert.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>What costs and fees apply to membership?</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Alaska Youth Soccer membership fees apply to players only and cover players for the entire seasonal year. AYSA charges for unique players (not registrations) and bills the affiliate clubs directly for these fees. If a player is registered multiple times (e.g. in the Fall and in the Spring), the club is only charged once. Our simplified fee structure is based on the level of play. Recreational Status is $18, Competitive Status $30, and TOPSoccer Status $10.</p>
		<p>Coach, volunteer, or administrator registration with Alaska Youth Soccer comes at no cost for the individual. The affiliate club will cover the cost of the annual background check.</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<h3>What is the process for registering players and team officials?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<p>All AYSA registration for players and staff/volunteers is completed through your member club. Once your club registrar has confirmed that registration requirements have been met, he/she will process the registrations with AYSA and issue the passes for the players, coaches, volunteers, and team managers to the teams. These passes serve as proof of membership and participation eligibility.</p>
		<p>All players and team staff/volunteers MUST have a pass to participate in AYSA/USYS sanctioned games and tournaments. Passes must be presented prior to the start of every league or tournament game. No pass, no play.</p>
		<p>Once your club has issued your team’s passes, you will need to do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make certain there is a <b>current</b> and clear headshot photo on all passes. All photos should be taken at the beginning of the season.</li>
			<li>Laminate each pass.</li>
			<li>Punch a hole in the corner of each pass.</li>
			<li>Place all passes on a ring in alphabetical order.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> ALL passes used in each team competition must be from the same sanctioning organization (US Youth Soccer/AYSA) and must be from the same seasonal year. Passes can never be mixed, even if a tournament advises otherwise.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>What are the risk management requirements for staff &amp; volunteers?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<p>Passes for all team staff/volunteers and officials cannot be issued without an approved background check and SafeSport certification.</p>
		<p>Background checks and SafeSport certification requirements are outlined in the <a href = "/assets/129/6/AYSA000104-214_Membership_Club-11-12-20.pdf" target = "_blank">Membership Club/League Policy</a>.</p>
		
		<h5>Background checks</h5>
		<p>Background checks are required for everyone (employee, contractor, staff, board member, or volunteer) associated with a club, who has a responsibility for players or the club.</p>
		<p>Background checks are submitted through the club GotSoccer account. Contact your club registrar if you have an existing account and do not know your login information. If you do not have an account, your club registrar will create one for you and send you your login information.</p>
		
		<h5>SafeSport</h5>
		<p>The entire SafeSport course consists of three phases and is approximately 1-2 hours. The course certification expires after one season and a refresher course will need to be completed each season thereafter. The refresher course takes approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.</p>
		<p>Requirements for completing SafeSport certification can be found in the <a href = "/assets/129/6/POLICY_NO_AYS082217-A-Adult_Verification_8-22-17-update-2-12-19.pdf" target = "_blank">Adult Verification Policy</a>.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>What should be carried in a team's binder?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Passes should be carried with the team to all games, scrimmages, tournaments, and events. Medical release waivers will be completed online in the club GotSoccer account. Contact your club registrar if you require a copy of the waivers for a tournament. Be mindful that these items contain confidential information and should always be kept in a secure location.</li>
			<li>Birth certificates are <strong>NOT</strong> to be carried in the team binder/folder due to risk management liabilities. Birth certificates are to be uploaded to the individual player profile, and age verification will be done on the club level. Birth certificates are only required for State Cup and Regionals credentialing and can be carried in the folder at that time only.</li>
			<li>There is no need to have the other registration forms such as the Code of Conduct and concussion forms in the team binder or folder. Your registrar will have access to those forms if needed.</li>
		</ul>	
	</div>
	
	<h3>What steps need to be taken for team travel?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>To ensure your players are properly covered under AYSA insurance, make certain that your teams participate only in US Youth Soccer sanctioned tournaments. Listings of these tournaments can be found on US Youth State Association websites. Click <a href = "https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/state-associations/" target = "_blank">here</a> for the US Youth listing of state websites, then find the &quot;competitions&quot; or &quot;events&quot; option for sanctioned tournament listings.</li>
			<li>AYSA travel approval must be obtained for all out of state tournaments.</li>
			<li>All teams planning to attend an out-of-state US Youth sanctioned tournament must apply for an online Annual Travel Permit (available <a href = "/resources/team-travel-forms/" target = "_blank">here</a>) and obtain approval from the state office. Travel requests should be submitted at least 30 days before travel.</li>
			<li>An AYSA Guest Player Form is required for a guest player from another club within Alaska. You can find the Guest Player Form <a href = "https://goo.gl/forms/fsxQid7DZBbG9xaO2" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li>
		
		</ul>
	
	</div>


	<h3>What procedures need to be followed for players to play with a team in another state?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<p>Any player wishing to play on a team of a member of a US Youth Soccer state association other than the US Youth Soccer state association where the player is registered must complete an <a href = "/assets/129/6/19-Interstate_Permission-Release_to_another_State.pdf" target "_blank">Interstate Permission Form</a> and receive written clearance from the state association where the player is registered AND the state association of the team on which the player wishes to play.</p>
		<p>Circumstances that require interstate permission include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A player requesting permission to play as a member of a team of a state association (the &quot;Accepting State Association&quot;) other than the state association in which the player is registered or resides (the &quot;Releasing State Association&quot;).</li>
			<li>A player requesting permission to play on a team in another state association as a guest player.</li>
			<li>A player is relocating/moving from one state association to another state association during the seasonal year.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	
	<h3>What procedures need to be followed for players moving from another country?</h3>
	
	<div>
		<p>ALL clubs with a legal, financial, or de facto tie to a professional team will be required to obtain international clearance approval for all foreign-born players regardless of citizenship. Reach out to your club registrar to find out if international clearance is required of your club.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mandated by FIFA.</li>
			<li>The player must submit required documentation to their club registrar for submission to AYSA.</li>
