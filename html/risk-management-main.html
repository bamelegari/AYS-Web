<h3>Adult Background Checks</h3>
<h5>Adult Seasonal Passes</h5>
<p>US Youth Soccer adult seasonal passes will be issued through the approved Alaska Youth Soccer State website and program. Currently, AYSA is utilizing GotSoccer. Each affiliate club and/or association must establish and maintain an account with GotSoccer. All adult volunteers requiring a seasonal pass will be registered in the GotSoccer system. This will assure that programs and leagues are following the standard that is common practice for all clubs with US Youth Soccer. AYSA requires that each adult working within the youth program have submitted and passed their annual adult background check through AYSA.</p>

<h5>SafeSport Training</h5>
<p>Alaska Youth Soccer has Zero Tolerance for Abuse; the Adult Verification Policy and Guidelines are intended to create a safe and nurturing environment in which athletes may receive the benefits unique to sports participation, preparation, and competition.The training will provide better understanding of the risk of child sexual abuse, information necessary to protect athletes from sexual abuse, and the adult responsibility to act in the best interest of the athlete. The awareness training is required for all individuals over eighteen participating in the programs of AYSA or affiliate member associations.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Before regular contact with an amateur athlete begins, the adult must clear the background check and within the first 35 days of taking on the role giving them access to youth participants, and must complete the initial SafeSport training. A refresher course is required on an annual basis effective the calendar year following the completion of the initial training.</p>
